# Handwritten Text Recognizer (Course Project)

This repository contains a **handwritten text recognition system** developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence Laboratory** course at *Sapienza University of Rome*.

It is based on the original group project implemented in **Java**, with additional testing and evaluation scripts contributed in **Python**.  
The project explores techniques in **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **optical character recognition (OCR)**.

---

## 1. Overview

The goal of this project was to design and implement a system capable of recognizing handwritten text from scanned images using deep learning models.  
The system combines convolutional and recurrent layers with the **Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)** loss to align text sequences with image data.

The testing and evaluation modules included in this version were developed by **Gioia Zheng** to measure model performance and visualize results.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Implement a **neural network-based OCR pipeline**
- Explore **feature extraction**, **image preprocessing**, and **text decoding**
- Evaluate model accuracy using **Character Error Rate (CER)** and **Word Error Rate (WER)**
- Conduct experiments on real-world datasets (IAM Handwriting Database)
- Understand trade-offs between model complexity and recognition accuracy

## 5. How to Run (Python Evaluation)

### Step 1 — Install dependencies

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib opencv-python torchmetrics
````

### Step 2 — Run the testing module

```bash
python testing.py
```

This will evaluate the model on the IAM dataset and print results including CER and WER metrics.

## 6. Sample Output

```bash
our prediction: the quick brown fox
our answer: the quick brown fox
our final character error rate: 0.042
our final word error rate: 0.083
```
